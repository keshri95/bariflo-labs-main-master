It aerates by considering sediment oxygen Demand (SOD) of the waterbody .The aeration is a wave generation microbubble aeration that aerates by a mechanism at the sediment-water interface (SWI). This helps to reconstruct the oxidized layer. One module can aerate up to 1 hectare of the Aqua-pond. Lotus is 50% more energy efficient than Paddle wheel, propeller aspirator. It transfer rate of oxygen to water from air is twice of blower and micro bubble tubes.",
